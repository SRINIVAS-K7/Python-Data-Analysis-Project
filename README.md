# Python-Data-Analysis-Project

Overview :

   This project analyzes a healthcare dataset to understand factors associated with stroke occurrences. Using Basic Python  and libraries like Pandas and NumPy we perform 
   data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and generate meaningful insights to support preventive healthcare decisions.

Dataset Description : 

   The dataset consists of patient demographic and health-related information. Each row represents one patient record.

   Column Name
   id	:
   Unique identifier for each patient
   gender	:
   Gender of the patient: Male, Female, or Other
   age:
   Age of the patient in years
   hypertension	:
   1 if the patient has hypertension, 0 otherwise
   heart_disease:
   1 if the patient has a heart disease, 0 otherwise
   ever_married :
   whether the patient has ever been married
   work_type	Type of employment: 
   Private, Self-employed, Govt job, Children, Never worked
   Residence_type:
   Urban or Rural — type of residence
   avg_glucose_level:
   Average glucose level in the blood
   bmi: 
   Body Mass Index
   smoking_status	Smoking status: 
   formerly smoked, never smoked, smokes, unknown
   stroke	Target variable: 
   1 if the patient had a stroke, 0 otherwise

Objective :

   Identify key features contributing to stroke.

   Analyze trends and patterns related to stroke risks.

Tools & Technologies :

   Python - Basic

   Pandas – Data manipulation

   NumPy – Numerical operations

   Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

Project Workflow :

   Import Libraries

   Load Dataset

   Initial Exploration

   Dataset shape

   Data types

   Null value check

   Data Cleaning

   Handle missing values

   Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

   Distribution of stroke vs. non-stroke

   Compare glucose, age, BMI with stroke status

Insights Summary :

   Age and glucose levels have strong influence

   Hypertension and heart disease are significant risk factors

   Certain work types and smoking habits show correlations

Insights :

   Stroke is more prevalent in older age groups (≥ 60).

   Higher average glucose levels correlate with stroke occurrences.

   People with hypertension or heart disease have a higher risk.

   Smoking status has indirect association depending on other factors.
